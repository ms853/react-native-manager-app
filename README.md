# react-native-manager-app
My personal project I developed this alongside studying the react-native course on Udemy, taught by Instructor Stephen Grider. 

About the app
-------------
It is a mobile application, that allows managers to add their employees to the app. The main functionalities right now are the CRUD functions - create, read, update and delete employee information. 
In addition, Managers can text the shifts assigned to their employees.
